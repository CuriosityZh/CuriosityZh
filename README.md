# Hi there 👋, I’m CuriosityZh

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Below is a bit about me, what I do, and what I’m working on.

---

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 I’m passionate about software engineering, distributed systems, game theory, and blockchain.
- 🛠️ My preferred stack includes **C# / .NET**, **TypeScript / Node.js / React**, and I enjoy working with **databases, algorithms, and multiplayer systems**.
- 💡 I love building projects that blend logic, simulation, and interactivity — for example, gaming variants, negotiation systems, or multiverse/time-travel concepts.
- 🌱 I’m always learning new paradigms: functional programming, AI, concurrency, formal methods.
